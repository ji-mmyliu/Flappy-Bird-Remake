# Flappy-Bird-Remake
A remake of the Flappy Bird mobile game using HSA console (Ready to Program) in Java. Made for the ICS3U final project.

To run the game on your local machine, install the [Ready To Program Java library](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/) (not the Turing library). Then run the `FlappyBird.java` file using the RTP Java IDE.


Made by Jimmy Liu and Ray Wang.
